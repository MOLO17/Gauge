/// A `GaugeHand` represent a hand which shows the current value of the `Gauge`,
/// and a default hand that provides such "visual behavior" is provided. You
/// can create your own class implementing this protocol and have it highlight
/// the current value in a totally different way.

    ///   - angle: The computed angle (used for the rotation) of the hand. It's
    ///   in cartesian coordinate space. By using the angle for rotation the
    ///   hand should point to the target.
    ///   - innerTarget: The point of the target. It touches on the inner side
    ///   of the track.
    ///   - outerTarget: The point of the target. It touches on the outer side
    ///   of the track.
    ///   - value: The current value of the Gauge.
    ///   - bounds: The bounds of the Gauge.
