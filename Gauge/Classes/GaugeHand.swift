/// injection of custom hands in the `Gauge`.
///
/// A `GaugeHand` represent a hand which shows the current value of the `Gauge`,
/// and a default hand that provides such "visual behavior" is provided. You
/// can create your own class implementing this protocol and have it highlight
/// the current value in a totally different way.

    /// Possible reasons include bounds changes and obviously value changes.

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - angle: The computed angle (used for the rotation) of the hand. It's
    ///   in cartesian coordinate space. By using the angle for rotation the
    ///   hand should point to the target.
    ///   - value: The current value of the Gauge.
    ///   - valueInner: The point, within the provided bounds, touching the
    ///   inner side of the track at the `Value` position.
    ///   - valueOuter: The point, within the provided bounds, touching the
    ///   outer side of the track at the `Value` position.
    ///   - bounds: The bounds of the Gauge.
    ///   - zeroInner: The point, within the provided bounds, touching the inner
    ///   side of the track at the 0 position.
    ///   - zeroOuter: The point, within the provided bounds, touching the outer
    ///   side of the track at the 0 position.
    ///   - trackThickness: The width of the track of the `Gauge`.
